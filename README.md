# Princeps

**Version:** 0.3.2

A private AI workspace that functions as a personal executive secretariat. Princeps gives individuals the same operational leverage that high-performing executives build around themselves through chiefs of staff: preparation, memory, coordination, and structured follow-through.

Every feature writes to a single user-scoped Postgres database. The LLM assistant is context-aware across all of it — not just the chat history.

## Requirements

| Requirement             | Minimum version    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Node.js                 | 20                 |
| npm                     | 10                 |
| Docker & Docker Compose | any recent version |
| PostgreSQL (via Docker) | 18 with pgvector   |

**LLM provider (choose one):**

| Provider | Purpose                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Ollama   | Local chat completions + local embeddings |
| OpenAI   | Chat completions + embeddings via API     |
| Groq     | Chat completions via API (no embeddings)  |

All three providers share the same `callChat()` / `streamChat()` / `embed()` interface defined in `lib/llm-providers/`. The active provider is selected at runtime; embeddings fall back to the configured embed provider independently.

**Optional external services:**

- Upstash Redis — for distributed rate limiting (falls back to in-memory if absent)
- Langfuse — for LLM observability in production
- Stripe — for billing and subscription management

## Architecture

The codebase is organized in strict layers. The layering is enforced by convention — every feature follows the same shape and no layer reaches into another's responsibilities.

```
prisma/schema.prisma         Data model — IDs (cuid), enums, indexes
lib/<feature>/               Server logic — Zod schemas, CRUD operations, side effects
app/api/<feature>/           API routes — thin: auth → parse → delegate → respond
lib/tools/                   LLM tool layer — registry, executor, per-feature handlers
lib/context/                 System prompt assembly — one slot file per feature
lib/llm-providers/           Provider abstraction — callChat, streamChat, embed
lib/chat/                    Chat persistence and streaming orchestration
components/<feature>/        Client UI — shell, cards, dialogs, logic/ hooks
app/(app)/<feature>/page.tsx Server pages — auth, data fetch, serialize, pass to shell
messages/{en,de}.json        i18n strings — flat namespaced keys
lib/tiers/                   Tier enforcement and quota gating
lib/stripe/                  Billing — checkout, portal, webhook sync
```

### LLM tool system

The assistant can take actions (create tasks, search knowledge, update contacts, etc.) using OpenAI function-calling. Tool definitions live in `lib/tools/registry.ts`. The executor in `lib/tools/executor.ts` dispatches by tool name to per-feature handler files in `lib/tools/handlers/`. Adding a new feature's tools means creating one handler file and spreading it into `HANDLERS` — the executor is never touched.

Tools are feature-agnostic: the same executor handles calls from the chat stream, cron jobs, and any future surface.

### Context assembly

Before each LLM request, `lib/context/build.ts` assembles the system prompt from slot files — one per feature (`tasks.slot.ts`, `meetings.slot.ts`, `contacts.slot.ts`, etc.). Each slot retrieves and formats a section of the user's live data. The result is a complete system message injected into every request, grounding the assistant in the user's actual workspace state.

### Server/client boundary

Modules that import Prisma, Better Auth server helpers, or LLM provider code carry `import "server-only"`. API routes and server pages enforce auth independently — middleware (`proxy.ts`) is not considered sufficient. All DB queries filter by `userId`.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ColdByDefault/Princeps.git
cd Princeps
npm install
```

### 2. Start the database

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Run migrations and seed

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs Turbopack and is preceded by a DB healthcheck (`scripts/db-healthcheck.ts`) that aborts startup if Postgres is unreachable.

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

### Authentication and Session Management

Handled entirely by [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) with email/password credentials and session cookies. Sessions are stored in Postgres via the Prisma adapter. Every API route and server page reads and validates the session independently — middleware alone is not the trust boundary.

User accounts carry a `tier` field (`free` | `pro` | `premium` | `enterprise`). `lib/tiers/enforce.ts` checks quotas against `UsageCounter` before mutating operations. Quotas include per-day and per-month LLM message limits, per-day widget chat limits, lifetime knowledge character budgets, and per-resource record caps.

### Billing and Subscriptions

Billing is handled by Stripe. `lib/stripe/` contains checkout session creation, customer portal access, and webhook sync. Subscription events update the user's `tier` and `stripeCustomerId` in real time via Stripe webhooks. A pricing page (`/pricing`) renders plan cards driven by the tier configuration in `lib/tiers/`.

### AI Chat

A streaming, multi-conversation assistant backed by the configured LLM provider. Each conversation (`Chat`) holds an ordered list of `ChatMessage` records. Conversations are titled automatically from the first user message (a separate non-streaming LLM call).

The full system prompt is assembled by `lib/context/build.ts` on every request — pulling live data from all feature slots so the assistant always has the user's current workspace state. Tool calls are handled mid-stream: the executor resolves the tool name, calls the appropriate handler, and the result is appended to the stream.

Thinking mode sends a prefixed instruction to the model and strips the `<think>...</think>` block from the streamed response before it reaches the client. A floating chat widget (`components/chat-widget/`) is mounted in the root app layout and available on every authenticated page.

**Tier limits:** messages per month, tool calls per month, chats per day, widget messages per day.

### Knowledge Base (RAG)

Users upload documents (`.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`, `.docx`). The server parses the file using format-appropriate libraries, chunks the text, generates an embedding for each chunk via the configured embed provider, and stores the vectors in `KnowledgeChunk.embedding` (a `pgvector` column). No raw file blob is ever persisted.

On every chat request the user's message is embedded and a cosine-similarity query over `KnowledgeChunk` retrieves the top-N most relevant chunks, which are injected into the system prompt as a dedicated context slot.

Users also maintain a single **Personal Info** record — free-form text that is always prepended to the system prompt regardless of semantic relevance.

**Tier limits:** max documents stored, max single file size, lifetime characters processed (never decrements on delete — prevents delete-and-reupload bypass).

### Notification Inbox

A persistent inbox for LLM-generated and system notifications. The `Notification` model stores category, title, body, read state, and a dismissal flag. The notification stream is delivered to connected clients via Server-Sent Events (`app/api/notifications/stream/`). Unread count is computed server-side and reflected in navigation in real time.

Notifications are generated by the LLM (briefings, nudges, greeting), by cron jobs, and by system events.

### Contacts

A relationship index backed by the `Contact` model. Each record stores name, role, company, email, phone, notes, tags, a last-contact date, and a `ContactInteraction` log. Contacts are exposed to the LLM via `lib/context/contacts.slot.ts` and are referenceable by name in tool calls via `lib/tools/resolvers.ts`.

**Shareable card links** — the `ShareToken` model issues a signed, time-limited token (24-hour TTL) that renders a read-only contact card to unauthenticated recipients.

### Meetings

The `Meeting` model stores title, date, duration, location, agenda, status (`upcoming` | `done` | `cancelled`), and a free-text summary field. Participants are stored in a `MeetingParticipant` join table linked to `Contact`. Meetings are exposed to the context slot layer and are referenceable in tool calls by title.

Google Calendar events are imported via the OAuth 2.0 integration (`lib/integrations/google-calendar/`, read-only scope). Imported events are created as `Meeting` records; subsequent syncs update rather than duplicate. Token refresh runs automatically; revoked-access errors are detected and the integration is deactivated cleanly.

**Tier limits:** max total meetings stored.

### Tasks

The `Task` model stores title, notes, status (`open` | `in_progress` | `done` | `cancelled`), priority (`low` | `normal` | `high` | `urgent`), due date, and an optional `meetingId` foreign key. Tasks are included in the daily briefing slot and the overdue nudge cron. The assistant can create, update, and complete tasks via tool calls.

**Tier limits:** max total tasks stored.

### Decisions

The `Decision` model stores title, rationale, outcome, status (`open` | `decided` | `reversed`), and an optional `meetingId` link to the meeting where the decision was made. Open decisions are surfaced in context so the assistant can avoid re-litigating settled reasoning.

**Tier limits:** max total decisions stored.

### Goals

The `Goal` feature tracks longer-horizon objectives with title, description, target date, and status (`open` | `in_progress` | `done` | `cancelled`). Goals are exposed through a context slot and are manageable via LLM tool calls.

### Memory

User-authored memory entries (`MemoryEntry`) are free-form notes the assistant stores and can later retrieve. They carry a `source` field (`llm` | `user`) so manually added entries are distinguished from assistant-generated ones. The memory context slot surfaces recent entries directly in the system prompt. Memory is distinct from the knowledge base — it is structured around personal recall rather than document retrieval.

### Reports

`AssistantReport` records aggregate activity across meetings, tasks, and decisions into a structured weekly digest. Report generation is triggered on demand or by the weekly cron. Output is rendered in a dedicated reports view.

### Labels

A cross-feature tagging system. `Label` records carry name and color. Labels attach to tasks, meetings, contacts, and decisions via separate join tables (`LabelOnTask`, `LabelOnMeeting`, etc.). The tool layer resolves label names to IDs with auto-create (`lib/tools/resolvers.ts`), so the assistant can tag items by name without prior setup.

### Daily Briefing

On each briefing trigger (cron or manual), `lib/briefings/` assembles a prompt from the user's agenda, open tasks, pending decisions, and goals, sends a non-streaming LLM call, and stores the result as a `BriefingCache` record and a `Notification`. Cadence is configurable per user (off / daily / weekly) from App Settings.

### Proactive Nudges (Cron)

Automated notifications triggered by real data conditions, evaluated by cron jobs in `app/api/cron/`:

- **Overdue task alert** — fires when at least one task is past its due date.
- **Meeting follow-up prompt** — fires when a completed meeting has no summary captured.
- **Weekly digest** — a Friday summary of decisions made, tasks closed, and meetings held.

Each nudge type respects a per-user cooldown stored in `UsageCounter` and can be individually toggled from App Settings. Timezone-aware day-of-week targeting uses the user's stored timezone preference.

### Settings

**Assistant Settings** — assistant display name, system prompt prefix override, response style hint, and raw Ollama generation parameters (temperature, top-p, top-k, context window size, repeat penalty).

**App Settings** — preferred locale (English or German), notification and briefing cadence toggles.

### Multilingual UI

All user-visible strings are managed through `next-intl` with flat namespaced keys in `messages/de.json` and `messages/en.json`. German is the default locale. The active locale is resolved server-side from a cookie set by the locale middleware and persisted in user preferences. Technical text, validation errors, and logs remain in English.
